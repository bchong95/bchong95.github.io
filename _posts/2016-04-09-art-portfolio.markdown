## Artist's Statement
One aspect about me that most people do not know about is that I have a passion for Art.
If you were to ask someone “who is Brandon Chong” they might say things like “oh, he’s a funny guy” or “he is a complete nerd that talks more about math and computers than his social life”.
It is true that I love math and I have always perceived the subject to be one where I can prove to my peers that I am intelligent in my own way, but art does something more than just that.
To me art is not merely “objects made with great skill and imagination” or “the process of giving a physical form to one’s own creativity”, but rather a way for me to expresses my emotions in ways no other language can.
When I make art, I am effectively showing others exactly what I feel; rather than letting others interpret my emotions, I show them.

Art is also a therapeutic process for me.
Similar to the Picture of Dorian Gray, my artworks get to retain the emotions that I do not want to feel.
When I am mad, I can always paint a picture and when I get up form my chair, I look back at the painting and feel happy.
Dorian Gray commits “ugly” crimes and his self-portrait gets uglier, but he retains his natural beauty.
Similarly, my pictures retain all the hate, anger, misery and stress I might accumulate throughout the day, which leaves me with only happiness.
Art is a passion of mine that many do not know I have.
I pursue art because it helps me truly express my emotions and is a therapeutic process for me.
