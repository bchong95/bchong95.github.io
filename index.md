## About Me

HI! My name is Brandon Chong.

I am a sophomore in the [College of Engineering](http://engineering.illinois.edu/) at the [University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign](http://illinois.edu/) studying [Computer Science](http://cs.illinois.edu/). Many ask me "Why Computer Science?". Computer Science is not like the other sciences in the sense that one does not sit in a lab, mix chemicals and take measurements. In fact, if I told a "scientist" that the fundamental laws of nature do not directly affect the outcome of my "experiments", then they would say that what I do is not even a science. But before I even took a physics, chemistry or biology course, there was me sitting in my math class solving quadratic formulas. I saw a friend of mine punching numbers into his ti-84 and write down solutions and finish his problem set before I solved my first problem. I asked him how and he then showed me how to program the quadratic formula into the calculator. It was at this moment that I knew Computer Science can make people's lives better and that is why I pursue this field of knowledge.

## Projects

### Science Bowl

Science Bowl is a trivia game based around science questions with its own set of [rules](http://scibowlstats.com/rules/). In my senior year of High School I was an active member of my school's Science Bowl team. Twice a week the team met for practices and simulated a round by running through a set of questions. The dilemma we ran into was that the more experienced members had already encountered the precompiled question sets multiple times. So in order for the practice rounds to feel more random and new, one would have to pick 25 questions by hand. Very soon the task of compiling the rounds became an arduous task, since questions were spread across several documents in varying formats; some were pdfs, others were word documents and some were simple text files. I decided that this was not an efficient use of anyone's time so in response I made a project, which came to be known as [ScibowlStats.com](http://scibowlstats.com/). This website would allow users to easily submit questions to be sent to a central database where those users could later view a random set of an desired number of questions. This database allowed for less time to be spent compiling questions, which meant more time for rounds and rounds with more random question sets, which better utilized each member's time during the practices. If you would like to learn more about what my project does please visit [brandonchong.net/ScienceBowl](http://brandonchong.net/ScienceBowl/). And if you would like to see a quick demo of the program fetching questions from the database please visit [brandonchong.net/ScienceBowl/QuestionViewer.php](http://brandonchong.net/ScienceBowl/QuestionViewer.php).


### Cubed

Cubed is a turn based strategy game that I helped develop for my [Video Game Design](#Harvard-Westlake_Video_Game_Design) class in my senior year of high-school.
For this game I developed the artificial intelligence.
If you are interested I write about my experience developing the game [here](#Harvard-Westlake_Video_Game_Design) and if you would like to play the game please go to [BrandonChong.net/Cubed](Cubed).

### Sealed Bids Calculator

In a sealed-bid auction, bidders can only submit one bid and therefore cannot adjust their bids based on competing bids. This mechanism is helpful for situations that call for dividing items evenly, among a group of people, that cannot be split into smaller pieces without completely losing their value ex. a chair. The process calls for every participant to mark down how much he values each item and gives everyone their fair share by using money as a buffer. When I saw the math behind how this process I immediately noticed that is was very repetive and almost excel chart like, so to my surprise I found no free calculators online, which why I decided to [make one](SealedBidsCalculator)

### Chong University

Chong University is a completely fictional university that I made up for fun. The reason I made it was to alleviate the stress that comes with applying to colleges. Whenever someone says "What if I don't get into a single college?", I'll tell them to apply to Chong University. Basically, it is a form where one can enter basic information and an email will be sent to them with an acceptance letter. I thought it was a really funny idea and took a minimal amount of code to implement, which is why I am so fond of it. For now I keep the website for Chong University at [brandonchong.net/ChongUniversity](http://brandonchong.net/ChongUniversity/). I encourage you to [apply](http://brandonchong.net/ChongUniversity/Apply.php) and [like Chong University on Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/pages/Chong-University/162046407286167)! And if you are interested in making your own fictional university I have all the code I used on [GitHub](https://github.com/bchong95/Chong-University) :)

## Experience

### NMSI Group

#### Programmer and I.T. Specialist - Summer '14

In the summer of my freshmen year I got an internship at [NMSI Group](http://nmsigroup.com). NMSI Group is a wholesale mortgage firm located at the heart of Koreatown. My responsibilities at NMSI varied from maintaining printers and setting up computers to web development to updating database schemas. The process and work flow was simple yet critical at every step. It starts with a broker coming to us inquiring about a loan for his client. The broker sends everything to in well formatted text file known as a [Fannie Mae 3.2 file](https://www.fanniemae.com/singlefamily/technology-integration). From there it was my job to write code to parse all the information and send all the data to our MSSQL servers. Once all the information is in our servers it's all about working with the data in meaningful ways. There is a lot of micro steps between receiving a loan and approving it for funding and it was my job to make sure that everything goes as smoothly and as efficiently as possible. I had many responsibilities and tasks at NMSI and I have documented them all here at [http://brandonchong.net/NMSI](http://brandonchong.net/NMSI)

### University of Illinois

#### CS 173, CS 125, and CS 241 Course Assistant - Fall '14 - Present

In the sophomore year of my undergraduate education, I was offered a teaching position at my university. [CS 173 - Discrete Structures](https://courses.engr.illinois.edu/cs173/) is a discrete math course, which teaches computer science majors the fundamentals of mathematics that they need in order to rigorously work with the concepts in their theoretical courses. This course has about 540 students and has a wide variety of students that come from many different majors, educational backgrounds, and interests. My responsibilities for this course consisted of 2 office hours, 2 discussion sections, and a weekly group meeting; summing up to 5 hours of responsibilities a week.

Another teaching position I was offered was [CS 125 - Intro to Computer Science](https://wiki.cites.illinois.edu/wiki/display/cs125/Home),which is the first computer science course many take at the university. This course consists of about 570 freshmen and comes represents the vast diversity in the computer science curriculum. My responsibilities for this course was 3 hours of office hours of week and on top of that I maintained course resources like wikis and forums and also help made sure the logistics work out (labs being graded correctly etc.)

In the spring of my sophomore year I signed up to be a CS 241 Course Assistant. [CS 241 - System Programming](https://courses.engr.illinois.edu/cs241/) is the final course in the intro computer science track and the stepping stone that all computer science majors take before going into their specialized 400 level courses. This course has only about 200 students, since it is only offered to majors who have decided to stick with the program after having taken CS 125, 173, 225, and 233. My responsibilities for this course involved autograding, machine problem design, and side projects, which averaged about 12 hours a week.

Teaching was probably the first time in my life that I knew exactly why I was staying up late at night and waking up early in the morning. I learned just as much in my time on [course staffs](./Teaching/) as I did as a student in lecture halls and hope to one day be on course staffs for many different courses to constantly meet new types of students and challenge myself to be the best educator I can be.

### Video Game Design

#### Lead Artificial Intelligence Designer and Programmer

In my senior year of High School, I took a video game design course. The course was structured as a semester long class project. The first couple of weeks were dedicated to learning just what was video game design and what roles people play in it. Eventually we agreed on a project, which came to be known as [Cubed](#Cubed) and split up into our prefered roles. Some chose to be artist, others writers, and I chose to be a programmer. This project was the first were I had the opportunity to work with people who thought completely differently for me. Little did I know that artists weren't satisfied with a grid full of primary colors (every piece of the game had to have character), writers weren't satisfied with a 2 paragraph plot (the pieces needed a reason to be there) and they in turn learned that programmers weren't satisfied with just functional code (there had to be efficiency combined with elegance). Eventually, the basic game logic was coded and the programmers had the liberty of picking a side project. I chose to make an artificial intelligence for the game. Starting with nothing but my basic knowledge of object orientated programming I researched A.I. algorithms and eventually made a rudimentary A.I. that could consistently beat half the class.

### Minecraft Club

#### Founder and President

In my senior year of High School I started the [Harvard-Westlake Minecraft Club](http://hwminecraft.com). It was in my junior year that I attended the school's yearly club panel, which is where all the clubs showcased what they had accomplished and try to recruit new members. After looking at the [list](http://www.hw.com/Portals/34/forms/US%20Club%20List%202012-2013.pdf) of all the clubs, I noticed that too many of the clubs were geared towards academics, some kind of community service, or in general something meant to look good on a college application. I wanted to break this stigma and founded the school's first club dedicated to playing a video game, something that would probably not show up on anyones resume or application, and meant purely to have a good time. As I was deciding which video game to pick for the club, I deemed that it would have to be multiplayer, cooperative, interactive and most of all non competitive and relaxing. From this I picked [Minecraft](https://minecraft.net/) and started up a server. My duties were to maintain the server from a technical standpoint and also to administer it from a social standpoint. I did not want people to grief, steal or murder on the server. But most importantly, I played the game like anyone else and interacted with the other members.

## Interests

### Powerlifting

For my entire life, I have and still do struggle with maintaining a healthy lifestyle. At some point I decided I need to get more physically active and got a gym membership and went several times a week with the initial goal of bodybuilding. I then tirelessly spent hundreds of hours researching the science behind fitness and nutrition. While surfing the many videos on youtube about fitness, I stumbled across a man named [Elliot Hulse](https://www.youtube.com/user/strengthcamp). Elliot goes on and on about "becoming the strongest version of yourself"

### League of Legends

[League of Legends](http://na.leagueoflegends.com/) is a massive online battle arena (MOBA), where users coordinate with other players to defeat the enemy team is a capture the base style setting. This is accomplished by selecting a character, which has a unique set of skills and mechanics that let you express yourself. I am neither good nor talented at the game, but I simply like playing on my free time. My summoner name is [bchong95](http://www.lolking.net/summoner/na/28365900).

### Visual Arts

#### Excerpt from Artist's Statement

One aspect about me that most people do not know about is that I have a passion for Art. If you were to ask someone "who is Brandon Chong" they might say things like "oh, he's a funny guy" or "he is a complete nerd that talks more about math and computers than his social life". It is true that I love math and I have always perceived the subject to be one where I can prove to my peers that I am intelligent in my own way, but art does something more than just that. To me art is not merely "objects made with great skill and imagination" or "the process of giving a physical form to one's own creativity", but rather a way for me to expresses my emotions in ways no other language can. When I make art, I am effectively showing others exactly what I feel; rather than letting others interpret my emotions, [I show them](ArtPortfolio).
