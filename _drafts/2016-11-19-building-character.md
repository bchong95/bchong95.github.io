## Talent Only Goes So Far (should save for threadmill story)

Now I don't want to imply that talent doesn't exist. I just think that talent will only get someone so far. Most people who end up doing engineering or another competitive discipline were probably the "top 1% in middle school" or some other achievement like that. Most will probably even get through most if not all of high school with minimal effort. It takes these students less time to do the homework assignments and will probably grasp some of the concepts faster. These students were probably playing video games while a lot of their peers had to study to maintain their A in calculus. But everyone will reach a tipping point where talent isn't enough to perform well in a competitive field.

I remember when I was in high school I knew two kids in one of the advanced math classes. One had the highest grade in the class while the other had the lowest grade in the class. Let
s call them Alice and Bob respectively. I remember Bob was talking to the teachers in the math department that they feel inadequate. Bob mentioned that they wished they were as talented as Alice so things would come easier to them. I knew both Alice and Bob. I told Bob that I carpooled with Alice once and they studied while in the car. Alice would even read the textbook while eating. Almost every minute of privacy is spent studying. Bob didn't believe me and said "No. Alice says that they barely study.". I remember all the math teachers had that look on their face. They saw situations like this happen before.

## Little Bit of Slope Out Run Y intercept

To this day I think both Alice and Bob were equally talented people. The only difference was that Alice learned at a younger age that talent would only get them so far in life. Alice developed better studying habits than Bob. My friend puts this phenomenon into great words: "A little bit of slope out runs a lot of y-intercept". That is to say that talent is y-intercept while hard work is slope. If one person is more talent then someone else but that other person works a lot harder, then eventually the harder working person is going to win out. I also learned that it is exactly hard work that fosters talent.

## 10,000 Hours ... yesterday.

A lot of people who are really smart and successful today tend to have already put in their 10,000 hours.
