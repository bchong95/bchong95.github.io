## Hardwork isn't sexy

I once knew a person that refused to do math on a whiteboard. They prefered to just think about it to themselves or scribble things on a sheet of paper in private. This really bothered me when I was trying to explain to them concepts. One time I got fed up and just asked them "why do you refuse to work on a whiteboard.". And they told me that they don't like people watching them struggle. They told me to go home and read up on "effortless perfection".

When I read up on the topic I found that it was applied to a lot of people and their conscious effort to appear well rounded by societial norms. It wasn't enough that a young person in college was smart, pretty, and had a great personality, but that they should appear as if it all came naturally. It's because whenever you meet these people you tend to ignore all the hours they spent in the library studying to ace that midterm. All the hours in the gym and endless amount of sweat to maintain that figure. All the sacrifices they made to get to where they are now. And the weirdest part is that they want you to overlook that, since it's sexier that way. The idea is that if two people are equally well rounded, then the one for whom it comes "naturally" is prefered. I think that it is ridiculous that hardwork is not appreciated by peers and the phenomenon has definately bled into engineering.

I see it all the time in engineering. If you asked an engineer if they would rather be smart or hardworking they would almost always pick smart. It's probably this belief that genious don't ever have to work a day in their lives. Its the general conscensious that smart is sexy in engineering. In a vacumn this is fine, but it has led to a cultural phenomemon of people who try to make hard work come of as talent. I have seen it countless of times when one engineer in college asks another engineer "How long did that assignment take you?". The response is almost always a fraction of the time it actually took. I once had a class where the instructor polled the class and asked a series of questions "How many people took 2 hours on the assignment?" and about 20% of the class raised their hand. No one raised their hand for more than 2 hours. It was extordinary to see the number of people who claim that the assignment took them only 2 hours and no one who admitted to needing more time. However the key takeaway was that a majority of the class never raised their hands. They were ashamed to admit that the assignment took then more time then their peers. This is not conducive to learning.
