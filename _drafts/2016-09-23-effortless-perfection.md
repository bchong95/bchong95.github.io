## Hard Work Isn't Sexy

I once knew a person that refused to do math on a whiteboard. They preferred to just think about it to themselves or scribble things on a sheet of paper in private. This really bothered me when I was trying to explain to them concepts, since it's really hard when you don't know what their thought process is. One time I got really fed up and just asked them "why do you refuse to think out loud?". And they told me that they don't like people watching them struggle. They told me to go home and read up on "effortless perfection".

When I read up on the topic I found out that it  applied to a lot of people and their conscious effort to appear well rounded by societal norms. It wasn't enough that a young person in college was smart, good looking, and had a great personality, but that they should appear as if it all came naturally. The problem is that whenever you meet these people you tend to ignore all the hours they spent in the library studying to ace that midterm. All the hours in the gym and endless amount of sweat to maintain that figure. All the sacrifices they made to get to where they are now. And the weirdest part is that they want you to overlook that, since it's sexier that way. The idea is that if two people are equally well rounded, then the one for whom it comes "naturally" is preferred. It is ridiculous that hard work is not appreciated by peers and the phenomenon has definitely bled into engineering.

I see it all the time in engineering. If you asked an engineer if they would rather be smart or hardworking they would almost always pick smart. It's probably this belief that geniuses don't ever have to work a day in their lives. It's the general conscientious that smart is sexy in engineering. In a vacuum this is fine, but it has led to a cultural phenomenon of people who try to make hard work come off as talent. I have seen it countless of times when one engineer in college asks another engineer "How long did that assignment take you?". The response is almost always a fraction of the time it actually took. I once had a class where the instructor polled the class and asked a series of questions "How many people took 2 hours on the assignment?" and about 20% of the class raised their hand. After seeing that no one raised their hand for more than 2 hours. It was extraordinary to see the number of people who claim that the assignment took them only 2 hours and no one who admitted to needing more time. However the key takeaway was that a majority of the class never raised their hands. They were ashamed to admit that the assignment took then more time then their peers. This is not conducive to learning.

## Imposter Syndrome

This constant exaggeration of how hard people have to work to succeed in engineering creates a lot of imposter syndrome. Imposter syndrome is when someone develops this feeling that are very inadequate to compared to their peers. Most of the time people with imposter syndrome are well ahead of the curve, but get discouraged when they hear that the assignment that took them 20 hours took their friend 30 minutes. What's even worse is when people get discouraged when watching more experienced people perform. When you are starting off at anything it's easy to confuse experience and knowledge for aptitude. For example if you are just starting to learn a skill and a task takes you hours while someone more experienced might only need a few minutes, then it's easy to get discouraged. Usually this isn't a problem when the person who is more experienced is competing at a different level. When Tiger Woods hits a ball and puts a spin on it that you thought was physically impossible for the win you don't suddenly lose your love of golf. Just because Linus Tovarlds made Git in 10 days, while I am struggling to open a callback shell doesn't mean I love programming any less. This is because with people like Tiger and Tovarlds you always keep in the back of your mind the number of hours they spent in the field and lab respectively. You always remember that they have spent more time perfecting their craft than you have probably been alive. However when it comes to something like school or work you tend to forget how many hours everyone else has put into their craft. You tend to make the assumption that everyone came in with the same background and put in the same number of hours, so the only thing determining success is innate talent.

I think a prime example of this is when freshmen enter Computer Science. A typical intro to computer science course at a large university will have hundreds of people taking the same course in their first semester. What a lot of people tend to forget is that those hundreds of fresh all come from different backgrounds. Some people literally walk into their first computer science class with absolutely no programming experience. While on the flip side you have some students who have been programming since they were 12, have a parent who is a professor of computer science and the another parent who is a lead engineer at top tech company. Those two people are obviously going to have a different experience of the same intro to programming course. But that's not the say that the person who is new to computer science is incapable of learning the craft. It just means that they are going to need more time to get on the same page as their peers. They are also going to work twice as hard to achieve half as much compared to their peers who have already invested thousands of hours into programming.

I think the key takeaway when in this situation is to remember that everyone is moving at their own pace. Everyone is on their own road to the strongest version of themselves. I think an easy example of this is the gym. When you are working out and there is someone who you see is lifting more, running faster, and being more explosive, than you shouldn't let that discourage you from meeting your own fitness goals. Even if your goal is to be stronger and a lot of people are lifting twice are much for three times as many reps you have to remember that everyone started somewhere. The person who is benching 315 for reps spent years pouring gallons of sweat into that exact same bench to one obtain the extra 50 lbs of lean body mass and the technique to move those weights effectively.
